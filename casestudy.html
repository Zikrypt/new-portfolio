                <hr>
                <p>
                    Pekamy Fresh Minds is a talent-connection platform built to bridge the gap between graduates,
                    interns, and companies in search of skilled individuals. This case study explores the end-to-end
                    process of designing and developing the platform from crafting a clean, user-focused interface to
                    building a secure backend system. The website features a smooth onboarding experience where users
                    can sign up, register, and create profiles to showcase their skills, while companies can browse,
                    shortlist, and connect with potential candidates. The goal was to deliver a modern, responsive, and
                    efficient platform that empowers young professionals and simplifies the hiring process for
                    organizations.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As the CTO and lead developer, I handled both the front-end and back-end development of Pekamy Fresh
                    Minds. I collaborated closely with the UI/UX team to ensure design consistency and user satisfaction
                    across devices. The front-end was built using React, CSS, and JavaScript to deliver a responsive and
                    visually appealing interface, while the back-end was powered by PHP and MySQL to manage user
                    registration, authentication, and data storage securely. The result is a fast, reliable, and
                    scalable platform that connects talent with opportunity seamlessly.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This project strengthened my understanding of full-stack web development, teamwork, and product
                    management. It enhanced my ability to translate design concepts into functional features, optimize
                    performance, and maintain security standards. Pekamy Fresh Minds now stands as a functional,
                    user-driven platform that demonstrates the power of purposeful design and efficient coding practices
                    in creating real-world impact.

                <hr>
                <p>
                    Everyday Motors is a modern automotive company focused on redefining car sales and service
                    accessibility through technology. This case study highlights the design and development of their
                    digital platform built to showcase available vehicles, streamline customer inquiries, and enhance
                    the overall user experience. The goal was to create a sleek, trustworthy website that not only
                    reflects the brand’s identity but also simplifies how users browse, compare, and request vehicle
                    details.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As the lead developer, I was responsible for both front-end and back-end implementation. On the
                    front-end, I designed a visually appealing, responsive interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
                    ensuring smooth navigation across all devices. On the back-end, I integrated PHP and MySQL to handle
                    vehicle data, customer registrations, and inquiry forms securely. The platform allows users to sign
                    up, view detailed car profiles, and send direct purchase or service requests all within a clean,
                    intuitive environment.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This project strengthened my expertise in building database driven applications and optimizing
                    performance for dynamic content. I also focused on creating a seamless flow between design and
                    function, resulting in an engaging digital experience for customers. Everyday Motors now operates
                    with an efficient online system that improves lead generation, enhances brand credibility, and
                    showcases the company’s commitment to innovation in the automotive industry.

                <h3 class="project-title" id="Solana Copy Trading Bot">Solana Copy Trading Bot</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    The Solana Copy Trading Bot is a powerful automation tool designed to mirror transactions from
                    specific whale wallets on the Solana blockchain. This case study explores the development of a
                    secure, efficient, and scalable Telegram-integrated bot that allows traders to automatically
                    replicate successful trades in real-time. The goal was to simplify crypto trading for users who want
                    to leverage on-chain data and follow top-performing wallets without needing deep technical
                    expertise.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As the lead developer, I engineered both the backend logic and user interaction flow. The bot was
                    built using Node.js and integrated with the Solana Web3.js library to fetch and execute blockchain
                    transactions. The Telegram interface was implemented using the Telegram Bot API, providing users
                    with simple commands for wallet linking, copy settings, and real-time notifications. Security was
                    prioritized through encrypted private key storage and restricted API access to prevent unauthorized
                    activity.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This project strengthened my understanding of blockchain development, automation, and secure API
                    integration. It also enhanced my ability to build reliable real-time systems that process live data
                    efficiently. The Solana Copy-Trading Bot now stands as a practical Web3 solution that empowers
                    traders to replicate on-chain strategies with ease, bridging the gap between technical blockchain
                    operations and user-friendly trading experiences.

                <h3 class="project-title" id="Secure VPN Application">Secure VPN Application</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    The SoftEther VPN Mobile App project was developed to bring secure and flexible VPN connectivity to
                    both iOS and Android users using the open-source SoftEther VPN protocol. This case study highlights
                    the process of building a cross-platform mobile solution that allows users to connect to private
                    networks, manage server configurations, and ensure secure data transmission across devices. The goal
                    was to provide a smooth, privacy-focused experience with modern UI design and seamless backend
                    integration.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As the lead mobile developer, I was responsible for integrating the SoftEther VPN core into a
                    mobile-friendly environment. The app was built using Flutter for cross-platform compatibility,
                    ensuring consistent performance and user experience on both iOS and Android. The backend integration
                    leveraged SoftEther’s open-source libraries, combined with secure API endpoints to manage server
                    lists, authentication, and connection logs. Additional focus was placed on connection stability, low
                    latency performance, and end-to-end encryption.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This project deepened my experience with network security, mobile app development, and open-source
                    system adaptation. It taught me how to optimize VPN protocols for mobile environments while
                    maintaining user privacy and compliance with app store requirements. The result is a reliable,
                    secure, and efficient VPN solution tailored for users who need enterprise-level security and easy
                    configuration directly from their mobile devices.
